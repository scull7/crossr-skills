# crossr-skills Harness v2 Upgrade — Progress

This file tracks the work to evolve crossr-skills into the canonical base harness, following the exact stacked PR discipline proven in the ferro-wave authz 16-PR chain.

## Completed Phases

### PR 1–8 (COMPLETED)
- HARNESS-SPEC.md + beautiful review HTML
- agent-harness skill v2 (with authz lessons)
- Fines moved upstream into core writers
- Reviewer + Errors enhancements (reviewability, traceability, policy gates)
- rust-axum-backend production patterns
- rust-frontend generic anti-slop guidance
- New standalone rust-tui skill
- harness-bootstrap executable + templates

## Verification & Completion (Post-Merge)

The full stacked PR chain (PRs #1–#10) has been merged.

### Post-merge verification performed
- All mandatory artifacts present (HARNESS-SPEC.md, AGENTS.md, features.json, progress.md, justfile, CLAUDE.md, rust-tui skill, bootstrap script + templates)
- `scripts/harness-bootstrap` tested successfully in clean environments
- Minor bugs in the bootstrap script fixed during verification (heredoc + chmod issues)
- features.json updated to mark the entire "harness-v2" effort as completed

## Final Status
**Harness v2 is complete and the repository is now self-hosting its own process.**

All future work on crossr-skills (and consuming projects) should follow the rules in HARNESS-SPEC.md.
